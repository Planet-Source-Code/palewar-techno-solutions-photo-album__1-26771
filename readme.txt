Hello Friends,

Using this small tool you can create your Photo Albums almost instantly.

What to Do ???????

1) Copy your all the picture files (gif or jpg files) in a folder.
2) Rename all the files 1.gif, 2.gif, 3. gif and so on. (This sequence will be followed in the album creation)
3) Now you can run this software, enter extention of your picture files eg. gif or jpg in first step.
4) Browse and select the folder where you have kept all your picture files.
5) Enter titles if you like to. and Click on create Button.
6) Voila you have done it. If it works fine, which it does usually ;-)
your album will open in whatever default internet browser you have installed on your system.


How to browse Images ?????
1) Goto you picture folder, from there open index1.htm
2) Click on left and right arrows at left bottom of the page
3) Select any Title from left Navigation Bar.


What actually happens ????

Simple.....
We all know that Internet Explorer or any other browser can open gif or jpg files...
so what this software actually does is create HTML pages each one linked to a single file which is opened in a separate frame.
What???  You  never heard of how to create HTML pages from VB???
It is very simple, HTML pages are nothing but text files or ascii files which we can generate by using 
simple File I/O commands of VB. just keep their extention HTM and you are done.

Bye - Bye .......
So friend, I think this explains everything. If you still have any queries just send a mail to me at palewar@hotmail.com

NOTE:-
In first step only write extension do not include '.' ie write only gif do not write .gif
